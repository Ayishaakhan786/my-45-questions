// Exercise 25
// First condition
let alien_color: string = "Green";
// here we apply the First condition which is the loop statement so,
//if(alien_color == "Green"){
 //   console.log("The player just earned only 5 points")
//}
// if we give the color "Green in input so we get that the above line"
// but if we give the another color in input so the output will become empty
// Second condition
alien_color = "Red";
if(alien_color == "Green"){
    console.log("The player just earned only 5 points")
}
// so, in Second condition whenever we pass the another value of the variable so it will give us empty output
// now we can see the both conditions.
